<h2>Declaration of Independence</h2>
<b>When in the Course of human events,</b> it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve 
the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, 
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent 
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. -- 
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the 
consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, 
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its 
foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely 
to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established 
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that 
mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing 
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably 
the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, 
to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. -- Such has been the patient 
sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former 
Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and 
usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. 
To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

<h2>Gettysburg Address</h2>
<p>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, 
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so 
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here 
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. 
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to 
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget 
what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which 
they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the 
great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for 
which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not 
have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of 
the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
